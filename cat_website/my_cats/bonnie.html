                    <h3>Bonnie's Origin</h3>
                        <p>Bonnie came into our lives in April of 2022. She was around 7 years old at the time and is now closer to 11. Me and my husband (Brandon) were living in Logan at the time, going to Utah State University for our bachelor's degree. 
                            Logan was far from our family, so we felt like we needed an emotional support animal, of sorts, and begged our landlord to let us get a cat. They finally agreed and we immediately took to Petsmart to find our new friend.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It was love at first site with Bonnie. She was the oldest kitty there, at 7ish years old, and had been there for months. From our understanding, she was surrendered because her previous owner could no longer care for her.
                            Her story pulled at our heart strings and we felt we <em>had</em> to have her. So we adopted her! She is an older cat, but never acts like it.
