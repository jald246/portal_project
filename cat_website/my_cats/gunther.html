            <h3>Gunther's Origin</h3>
                <p>Gunther is a special boy. He joined our family in August of 2023. He was 6 months old at the time, but is now 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>. I have a friend that works at Petsmart, and she made it known to me that someone was looking to rehome their 3 month old kitty. He, allegedly, was too much for the current owner to handle and they wanted to rehome him somewhere that already has cats.
                    My friend gave her my contact information and once the owner sent me pictures of him, I was hooked. Marceline and Bonnie weren't getting along as nicely as I would have hoped, so we thought that having another kitty for Marceline to play with instead of Bonnie would be the best for everyone. Oh, how wrong we were.
                    After bringing him home and getting him accustomed to our house, we quickly learned why his original owners thought he was too much to handle. At only 6 months old, he was chaos embodied. Constantly breaking things, bothering his sisters, and refusing to take no for an answer.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I'd like to say that afer 2 years of being in our family, he is no longer a rambnunctious baby, but I would be lying if I said that. He is still chaos embodied, as we have had to replace many dishes and child proof our house. We love him nonetheless, and I like to believe his siblings love him too.</p>
