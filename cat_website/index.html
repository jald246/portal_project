            <h3>What Inspired Us to Get Cats?</h3>
            <p>My Husband has always loved cats and I have always loved animals. I never saw myself as much of a cat person, as I only ever had dogs growing up. As we were living together, we knew wanted a pet. I always assumed we would get a dog, probably a small one because, at the time, we lived in an apartment.
              After much debate on our lifestyle, wants, and needs for a pet, we decided a cat would probably be best for us. Once we saw our first cat, we were in love! We adopted one, then another, then another, then one last one and our little family finally feels complete!
