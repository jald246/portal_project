            <h3>Nepter's Origin</h3>
                <p>If Gunther is chaos embodied, Nepter is kindness embodied. Nepter joined our family in January of 2024. He was 9 months old at the time, but he is now 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>. The same friend who told me about Gunther, told me about Nepter. At the time, she had just adopted a cat herself and her cat had been surrendered to the shelter alongside many other kittens. Nepter was one of those kittens. She showed me his page because she wanted be to adopt him so her and my cats can be "related". However, upon seeing him, I had my own reasons for wanting to adopt. He looked exactly like Gunther <strong>and</strong> they both shared the same birthday.
                I thought it was fate, that there were two boy cats who shared the same exact birthday and looked so alike. I felt like we had to get him to complete our family. So we did and we are so glad we did,
                Out of all of our cats, he is by far the most loving. So much so, that he will bite you if you are not loving him enough.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Though Neperson and Guntherson look alike, they are extremely different. Nepter does whatever his sisters tell him to do, and he does it happily. He will always take no for an answer (unless it is no pets, then he will bite) and he loves to cuddle. </p>
